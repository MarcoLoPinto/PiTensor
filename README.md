-------------------------------------------

PiTensor is a deep learning library implemented from scratch using NumPy. 

It aims to provide a clear and educational implementation of neural network components, including layers, activation functions, loss functions, optimizers, and metrics. 

This project is inspired by popular Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Features

- **Layers**: Linear, Convolutional, ReLU, Softmax, Sequential
- **Loss Functions**: CrossEntropyLoss
- **Optimizers**: SGD, Adam
- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Data Loaders**: MNIST Digit Recognizer dataset
- **Training and Evaluation**: Training loop, validation, and metric evaluation.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MarcoLoPinto/PiTensor.git
    cd pitensor
    ```

2.  Install the repository as a standard package:
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```
    otherwise, if you want to modify the code while using the package, install it in editable mode:
    ```sh
